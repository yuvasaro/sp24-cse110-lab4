1. (Assuming `add` is true) Line 9 prints `values added: {the sum of num1 + num2}`.
   
2. If `add` is true the variable `result` is created and contains the sum of `num1` and `num2`, and line 13 prints `final result: {the sum of num1 + num2}`. If `add` is false, the variable `result` is not created and the code returns an error because it tries to access the value of a nonexistent variable.
   
3. (Assuming `add` is true) Line 9 prints `values added: {the sum of num1 + num2}`.
   
4. Line 13 always returns an error because the variable `result` was given block scope due to the `let` keyword, and the console log statement tries to access the value of `result` outside of the block it was defined in.
   
5. (Assuming `add` is true) The code returns an error, because in line 5, `result` was declared as a constant, but line 7 tries to reassign it.
   
6. If `add` is true, the code returns an error because it tries to reassign a constant. If `add` is false, `result` is never declared, so the code also returns an error in this case.
